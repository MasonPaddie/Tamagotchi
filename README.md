# Tamagotchi
Tamagotchi mini-project for General Assembly

The application begins by asking the user for their choice of tamagotchi to play with. Although this was not in the original game, it can provide a nice touch. The tamagotchi will begin as an egg and will evolve into the selected companion at the age of 10. Initially, the age is set to zero and one year is added every 2 seconds. This will also add to your tamagotchi's hunger, boredom and sleepiness. Make sure to play, feed and tuck in your tamagotchi to ensure all of their respective points stay below 10!
